# Microsoft Teams Clone

This project is a part of the Microsoft Engage Mentorship Program, 2021.
The challenge was to establish a connection between a minimum of two participants who should be able to connect via this product and have a video conversation.

I have used WebRTC and socket.io for establishing the connection between two users.

## Feature Set

1. Video call between two participants
2. Enable the user to add and display name
3. Display time and date of both the participants
4. Enables the users to leave the call at any time

## Agile Methodology

I have implemented agile methodology by dividing the development phase into multiple sprints to improve my functionality.

After installing, run the script to host the application on a local host

```bash
